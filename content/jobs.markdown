### Are you an experienced RubyOnRails, Javascript & Netzke Developer?

If so, please send your resume and/or CV to info /at/ streamline-ss /dot/ com. We are hiring for contract work at this time for RubyOnRails development & Mobile application development (using a Javascript based toolkit). All work is remote with no need for on site placement at this time, however if you are in Northern California, that is a plus. I can answer any further questions directly here or via email.
