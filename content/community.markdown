### StackOverflow
I will be closely watching [StackOverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) for the "netzke" tag, providing answers whenever possible _([NomadCoder](http://twitter.com/nomadcoder), creator of Netzke, 2011-09-01)_.

### Wiki
GitHub-powered Netzke [wiki](https://github.com/skozlov/netzke/wiki) is becoming the primary source of documentation, including basic and advanced topics around the Netzke framework - tutorials, guides, FAQ, etc. Feel free to contribute to it by editing and creating new pages *(you'll need a GitHub account)*.

### Discussion Groups
For questions and discussions, feel free to join the [Netzke Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/netzke/). Before you can post there, you'll need to send the request for joining the group (please, mention *Netzke* in the subject), which is normally processed within a couple of hours (*this is the unfortunate anti-spam measure*).
